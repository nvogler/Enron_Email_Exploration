While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it\\'s not in Enron\\'s corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous \"Home Video\" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  However, there are a few rules to follow.1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron\\'s values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, \"Enny\" will also be awarded for \"Best Overall Video.\"If you have any questions about the \"Home Video\" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.

I am genuinely trying to be as reasonable as possible.  I am not trying to \"hold up\" the deal at the last minute.  I\\'m afraid that I am being asked to take a fairly large leap of faith after this company (I don\\'t mean the two of you -- I mean Enron) has screwed me and the people who work for me.I am generally ok with the concept of the option, the doc, and comp parameters.  In addition, I need assurances that 90 day retentions will be paid to the people we have identified who deserve them and haven\\'t received them and I need to know that the comp conveyed to me in 2001 is secure. It is unlikely that I would be here today if it weren\\'t for the collective comp conveyed to me during 2001.  I have received assurances from the two of you, Oxley, and Greg at different times as to the security of the comp received.  The messages generally start with \"it\\'s safe,\" \"don\\'t worry about it,\" \"all comp paid in 2001 advanced the interest of shareholders and the estate,\" \"low probability that there will be any issues,\" ....  At other times, particularly when you want me to commit to this deal, the logic changes.  The comp paid in 2001 becomes risky and will become a whole lot safer if I\\'m on the team.  While I recognize that Enron is a very strange and fluid place these days, it appears that at times the story changes depending on what you want me to do.When I ask for indemnification on comp paid to me in 2001 the answer is that it is off the table -- a non-starter.  Why?  Because the estate is negotiating the deal.  Then have them negotiate that on behalf of me.Because the buyer has no interest in legacy issues with the estate.  I wouldn\\'t be here but for the legacy issues with the estate -- it is definitely the buyer\\'s issue!Because people have too much to do to get this deal done to take the time to negotiate with each employee.  I am available at any time wherever you want me to be to discuss this matter if and when the estate/the buyer have time.Because we don\\'t know who from the buyer to negotiate with.  Someone from the buyer has to decide on comp and contract issues -- why not figure it out now.Because this deal is bigger than Tim Belden.  I\\'m not delusional.  I know that this is a big deal with a lot of moving parts.  If it\\'s bigger than me then it will likely move forward without me.Since I am not \"on the team\" right now, I am also working with a great deal less information than you have.  I respect your choice to differentiate the information disseminated to people \"on the team\" versus not \"on the team.\"  However, the consequences of that choice provide less information to me which creates a greater leap of faith in my mind.  For example, I have no idea how the mechanics of getting these options done, conveyed to the creditors/buyer/estate/judge works.  Louise inidicated that it would be a memo or some form of written document indicating the people and total dollars needed to secure them.  If that\\'s the case, you could add my indemnification amount (adjusted by probability of payout) to that total and it surely wouldn\\'t blow up the deal.  Unless, the probability of payout is high.Furthermore, I am not proposing that we change the basic employment doc (subject to comment from my lawyer, but I\\'ll try to keep immaterial changes to a minimum).  I am saying that a condition precedent for me is to negotiate a separate indemnification doc with the buyer.  At that point in time, I would hope that they have the time and the inclination to discuss such a doc.  Perhaps at that time, some of the 2001 comp issues will already be cleared through the bankruptcy judge making the discussion that much easier.  Based on various discussions with the two of you over the last couple of weeks I have been led to believe that such a decision is expected and perhaps imminent.  I don\\'t understand why this is a non-starter issue, but I don\\'t have the same information that you do.To be clear, here is the basic deal that I am willing to offer as a free option to the buyer:the deal as it exists plusretention payments for those still with the company who deserve them who have not yet received them.indemnification of 2001 comp up to $4 million.I expect that the two of you will tell me that I\\'m not on the team, that 800 people are going home, and that the Portland office will be moved to Houston if this thing survives.  That is not what I want to happen.  If this deal is bigger than me then those things shouldn\\'t happen.  I have given this a lot of thought over the last couple of days and came up with my conclusions.  I am open to any productive discussions that you would like to have.In talking through this stuff with Mike and Matt I realize what a hard position you guys are in.  I feel that I have lost ground rather than gain ground with them in the last couple of days.  I trust that you are trying to do the right thing.  There are just so many things that are uncertain right now that it makes it very difficult for me to give away the option that you have requested without firming up some other issues for me at the same time.  Finally, I apologize for hanging up on Louise ealier.  It\\'s probably better than me hearing what she was about to say and her hearing what I was about to say.  I will call to see that you received and read this e-mail.

I\\'ve been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.Stan Horton - Global ServicesLouise Kitchen - AmericasJohn Sherriff - EuropeMike McConnell - Global MarketsJeff McMahon - Industrial MarketsJanet Dietrich - RetailIf you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I\\'ve attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.   Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.Regards,Terrie JamesSenior Director, Corporate Communication(ph) 713.853.7727(fax) 713.646.3248terrie.james@enron.com FW: Just so you know -----Original Message-----From: \\tForster, David  Sent:\\tWednesday, October 17, 2001 11:13 AMTo:\\tKitchen, LouiseSubject:\\tRE: EESLouise,Attached is the list I have collected so far.

John Grass originally headed up the Wellhead desk and Outsourcing efforts for the producer segment.  I wanted him to do that because of the logistics overlap between purchasing wellhead gas and offering outsourcing services.2. When the volume of the Wellhead desk started to increase and based on my frustation with the lack of \"contract focus\" with Ocean Energy, Andex, and other producer outsourcing deals being pursued, I asked Kevin Miller to manage Producer Outsourcing and John Grass to manage only the Wellhead desk.3. Based on Kevin Miller\\'s memo (attached below), the Wellhead desk reporting into Hunter, I have been questioning the value of a separate outsourcing effort independent of the Wellhead desk.Regards, Mrha -----Original Message-----From: \\tMiller, Kevin  Sent:\\tFriday, October 12, 2001 4:46 PMTo:\\tMrha, JeanSubject:\\tProducer One UpdateJean, Per your request, attached herewith is the rather lengthy Producer One Update/ Thanks ...

In my opinion, utilities and municipalities do not fall within the EES target market of being \"less energy intensive and less sophisticated in their management of energy\" (see below). Neither would aggregators fall into this category.I am also concerned about the principle of EES approaching utilities to encourage them to act as an EES sales agent. I believe this ultimately results in little more than aggregation of load into wholesale levels - and in any case, results in multiple representatives from Enron pitching products which achieve similar results from the customer\\'s perspective.In addition, providing EES load management solutions may jeopordize other ENA projects which require that load (services deals, plant construction, etc. in addition to the usual wholesale product suite). I am concerned about the risk (however slight) posed by the EES activity as ENA actively tries to develop relationships with these customers and to close substantial wholesale transactions.I\\'ll wait for your thoughts on Monday before I go to EES with these concerns.Thanks,Dave -----Original Message-----From: \\tEnron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-Enron+20Announcements_Corp_Enron+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  On Behalf Of John Lavorato & Dave Delainey@ENRONSent:\\tFriday, June 22, 2001 3:05 PMTo:\\tENA Employees@ENRON; EES_Employees@EESSubject:\\tENA and EES Industrial SIC CodesINTEROFFICE MEMOFrom: John Lavorato & Dave DelaineyTo: All of ENA and EESRe: ENA and EES Industrial SIC CodesAs Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron\\'s reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact.

I\\'ve been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.Stan Horton - Global ServicesLouise Kitchen - AmericasJohn Sherriff - EuropeMike McConnell - Global MarketsJeff McMahon - Industrial MarketsJanet Dietrich - RetailIf you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I\\'ve attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.   Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.Regards,Terrie JamesSenior Director, Corporate Communication(ph) 713.853.7727(fax) 713.646.3248terrie.james@enron.com  Based on Dave\\'s planning process for next year, the attached organisation chart highlights the areas where cuts can be made.The yellow people can leave, the person in red is still under discussion.

Someone\\'s notes from the call.Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they\\'re simply in chronological order.The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  Specific points:EES will be a part of the new company.  Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for \\'very little\\' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE \\'has sufficient liquidity\\', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  In what was termed a \"new approach\", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  Lay says that Enron had other options, \\'particularly financial\\'.All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be \\'pretty big\\', but that the companies feel they\\'re able to appropriately value this exposure.Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.Dynegy says that \\'several\\' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there\\'s absolutely nothing else out there.Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had \\'close to a billion\\' in cash.  Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that \\'our backs are not against the wall\\', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.McMahon says \\'no comment\\' to WSJ article indicating that ENE\\'s banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won\\'t be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.Watson says that the \\'creative financing\\' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, \\'frankly\\', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model (uh-oh).  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by \\'Enron\\'s top three executives\\', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy\\'s deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they\\'re NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron\\'s books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron\\'s assets or businesses.  Dynegy\\'s lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a \\'blunt instrument\\' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron\\'s total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there \\'could\\' be more restatements, but he \\'does not expect\\' there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies \\'very positive\\' to combined entities.  McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy\\'s earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a \\'25% haircut\\' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy\\'s books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a \\'very very substantial\\' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco\\'s investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco\\'s investment is now at a \\'more substantial\\' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get \\'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better\\'.  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that \\'we\\'ll retain\\' the Enron traders and marketers. They\\'re used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are \\'very excited\\' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that \\'to the extent necessary, yes.\\'Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he\\'s a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.Give me a call if you\\'d like me to try to clarify any of these comments.Patrick Tuckerx3-3055 FW: You have it - it goes to two pages but you have it -----Original Message-----From: \\tBrown, Sarah  Sent:\\tMonday, November 12, 2001 11:01 AMTo:\\tKitchen, LouiseCc:\\tKillen, FaithSubject:\\t2002 Consolidated Plan ScheduleHere\\'s the 2002 Consolidated Plan Schedule.Thanks,Sarah Brown   That\\'ll HAdn\\'t noticed you lowered Redmond until today.

The Limited Partnership assets include a $690 million n=ote payable from Enron and certain merchant investments, both domestic and =international.  Enron anticipates the receipt of $250 million from the sale= of one of the Limited Partnership\\'s investments, a local gas distribution =company in Brazil, upon the closing of the sale which is pending certain re=gulatory and other approvals.  Enron may be required to use the net proceed=s upon the closing of the sale, or a portion thereof, to repay a portion of= the note payable. =20=09The November 12, 2001 downgrade in Enron\\'s senior unsecured debt rating =to BBB- by Standard & Poor\\'s has caused a ratings event related to the Limi=ted Partnership.  This ratings event started a nine business day period dur=ing which Enron has the right, until November 26, 2001, to either post an u=nsecured letter of credit equal to Enron\\'s note payable, repay the note pay=able with the Limited Partnership investing such proceeds in permitted inve=stments, or to purchase the investors\\' interest in the Limited Partnership.=  To the extent that Enron does not satisfy this requirement by November 26=, 2001, the investors have the right to immediately begin to liquidate the =Limited Partnership assets.  Additionally, as a result of the rating downgr=ade, the investors, subject to certain actions, are able to accelerate and =assign the note payable.  Consistent with the restructuring plan discussed =in Note 2, Enron is currently working with the lenders to develop a mutuall=y acceptable amendment or waiver to the transaction documents in order to a=void an early Enron payment obligation. =20=09Either as a result of the restructuring plan discussed in Note 2 or to r=aise cash to repay Enron\\'s obligation discussed above, Enron may sell the L=imited Partnership assets for amounts below their carrying values.  The net= proceeds from the sale of such assets can be used to repay Enron\\'s obligat=ion.  Accordingly, Enron may be required to record asset writedowns, possib=ly as early as the fourth quarter of 2001.=09It is not possible to predict whether Enron will be able to favorably co=mplete the actions described above.  In the event that Enron fails to pay a=ny debt obligations when due, including when such obligations may be accele=rated, or is unable to refinance or obtain a waiver of its obligation, a se=ries of events would begin which could impact Enron\\'s compliance with the t=erms of its Revolving Credit Agreements and certain other obligations, incl=uding bank debt facilities. =20Louise KitchenChief Operating OfficerEnron AmericasTel:  713 853 3488Fax: 713 646 2308 AEP Not good.Tracey Ngo was excellent.Huge salary increase and sign on. FW: Energy Cos Limit Business With Enron After 10Q -TradersBy Mark Golden11/20/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Many energy trading companies were unwilling to sellpower and natural gas for next day delivery to Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesdaymorning, a result of heightened credit concerns following the release ofEnron\\'s quarterly financial report Monday, traders and other sources said.  For weeks, companies have limited both buying and selling with Enron forfuture deliveries. But for the first time since Enron\\'s troubles began a monthago, energy companies weren\\'t selling to Enron in the spot markets for fearthat Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month.  \"It\\'s pretty well accepted in the industry that people are staying away fornow,\" said Charlie Sanchez, energy market manager for Gelber & Associates inHouston.  Traders at all of the major companies contacted said they couldn\\'t sell toEnron Tuesday morning. Several spokespeople for energy companies confirmed thesituation, but declined to say so on the record.  \"Nobody will take Enron,\" one western electricity broker said. Afterstruggling, however, that broker eventually found a utility that was willingto sell to Enron Tuesday morning.  Calpine, a prominent independent power producer and trader, said it waswilling to sell power to Enron.  \"We continue to sell power to Enron and are monitoring the situationclosely,\" spokeswoman Catherine Potter said.  The situation Tuesday morning was fluid. One utility that refused to sell toEnron in the morning was willing to do so in the afternoon, a person at thecompany said. That company\\'s trading, however, was still limited to the spotmarkets.  Credit concerns about the once-dominant energy trading company wereheightened with Enron\\'s filing of its third quarter annual report Mondayevening with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.  Enron may have to pay $690 million on a note that became a demand obligationwith the company\\'s most recent credit-rating downgrade, Enron said in Monday\\'sfiling. The company also warned that its profits in the fourth quarter couldbe hurt by credit concerns, a decline in asset values and reduced tradingactivity.  \"The 10Q in and by itself is a document that could raise concerns,\" Fitchanalyst Ralph Pellecchia said. \"We have a lot of questions outstandingrelative to disclosures that were new to us and their strategies of how theyare going to manage the situation.\"  Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets,because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses nocredit risk for the buyer.

This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.Strategic Asset  DevelopmentLaura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.Central Origination and Mid-MarketFrank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.  There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.Louise & John\\t\\t\\t\\t FW: Just what I needed! -----Original Message-----From: \\tPower, Bobbie  Sent:\\tWednesday, October 24, 2001 9:56 AMTo:\\tBowen Jr., Raymond; Brown, Michael - COO London; Buy, Rick; Causey, Richard; Delainey, David; Derrick Jr., James; Dietrich, Janet; Fallon, Jim; Fastow, Andrew; Frevert, Mark; Glisan, Ben; Haedicke, Mark E.; Horton, Stanley; Hughes, James A.; Kean, Steven J.; Kitchen, Louise; Koenig, Mark; Lavorato, John; Mcconnell, Mike; McMahon, Jeffrey; Shankman, Jeffrey A.; Sherriff, John; Whalley, GregCc:\\tSchiller, Marsha; Rapacioli, Marisa; Heathman, Karen K.; Westbrook, Sharron; Chapman, Kay; Harris, Stephanie J; Marshall, Lucy; Maronge, Bridget; Daw, Nicki; Dauterive, Inez; Elbertson, Janette; Stark, Cindy; Blackwood, Connie; McVicker, Maureen; Schoppe, Tammie; Valencia, Laura; Hillis, Kimberly; Fleming, Rosalee; Wells, Tori L.; Williamson, Joannie; Phillips, Cathy; Ford, Sue; Burns, Jennifer; Ferrari, Kerry; Taylor, Liz; Tilney, Elizabeth; Palmer, Mark A.

We need to have further meeting later with our staff to determine if we should offer other people jobs.  We have a lot of front office spots.  Slone, you need to get us a front office count by region. I suggest that Hunter and Dave Ryan coordinate interviews for outside weather guys for next Monday.  We should bring in 10 if we can and hire 2 or 3.   I suggest Presto works with Gaskill and Will and the H guy I can\\'t spell in Portland to put together gas and power fundies presentations for a week Tuesday.  I would like to have a clue before I start trading. Hunter on the gas trading side I say we put all front office into 4 groups and give them a task to come up with the best Organization structure.   It will get everyone working.  We need that.  I would suggest that we start projecting our groups to death so they\\'re focused on business. I also suggest we put all the screens on the floor to commodity prices to keep people from watching Enron shit all day.
